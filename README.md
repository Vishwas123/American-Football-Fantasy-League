# American-Football-Fantasy-League

This application consumed Angular.JS, HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, JQuery, JQuery UI and other basic stuff.
Users can select their favourite players and let them play in the ground and win points for them. This will make you think how good you are at guessing the performance of the players.
The application is under renovation but the main sculpture (i mean prototype), is designed. You can go through the application and let me know if you think that any part of the application needs to be changed.
I appreciate your response because there is always a scope for improvement.

"When you open the application as a collection of separate files, please do open the index file first" This is a request for new programmers.
